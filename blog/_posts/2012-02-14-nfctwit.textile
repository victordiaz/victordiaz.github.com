I created a small working prototype of tangible twitting. I made some cards to be placed in different places and when I tap them using my phone I could automatically twit where am I 

The magic behind is pretty easy, in fact there is no magic, is just NFC. My phone, a Nexus S, has a NFC reader that I used to scan the tags that were placed behind the cards. Each tag has a different id number that is linked to a different place which is used to send the appropriate text to twitter :)
