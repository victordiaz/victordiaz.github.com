During some cool and sunny monday in Budapest rather than hardcore programming, I just took a couple of phones and recorded some video sequences at the same time, attached them to my legs, etc you know, typical things you do on a Sunday afternoon in Budapest 

Afterwards I played a bit a editing them with the rhythm of Yonderboi  and here is the result! (I am learning to edit videos as well during this process!!)
