In this experiment I wanted to play a bit with the Arduino ADK, a nice hardware prototyping tool that allows you to create almost whatever! 

I made a small racing game for Android where you have to avoid the obstacles that appear on the road. The funny thing is that you are not controlling a digital car! you control a tangible one. Just tilt the phone and you can see how the car is moving on top of the screen. When the car crashes with the digital obstacles the game finishes. Enjoy!
